This app is a command line interface done using python and the psycopg library.

Below is a overview of how the application is expected to be used.





A user registers and then logs in, now this user can keep track of his health stastics and workout routines and efforts. When he completes them he can mark them as such
and this now becomes an achievement he can view and be prouf of. The user can also see all open training sessions that arent full and register into them.

A trainer can see what rooms are open and if they are not busy they can create a session and specify the time it starts and ends, when users join he can see all the users that join
and see there profiles, he can also search profiles by name. 

The administrators can book new rooms and manage the sessions, they can also see all bills and update all relevent info for sessions and bills if edits need to be made.
When a user is first registered a bill is created for $30.0
